ng --version

#To create new component
ng g component appointment-list

#To create Interface
ng g interface models/appointment

#To generate module
ng g module home
ng g component home --module=home

ng g service product/product

ng g class models/product

ng g environments

ng serve --configuration=production

###
ng serve -o

npm install -g @angular/cli@14


npm install @angular/cli@16.1.6 --location=global

npm unstall  @angular/cli --location=global

npm install bootstrap@5.3

if you have decided to go with version 17 over version 16 you will have to add the --no-standalone in the project creation command: ng new my-app --no-standalone
If you forget to add this flag you will have no global app.module.ts file which is required to register several services.
Again! If you create a new project with Angular 17 you have to add the --no-standalone option to the command
